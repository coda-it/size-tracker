# size-tracker

## How it works
This script checks weight of files that needs tracking (like binaries or scripts) from version to version.

## How to install
For now it's just a demo that can be manually copied and pasted into any project. If the project contains already a makefile it's important to merge it's tasks with the size-tracker tasks.

## How to use it
1. Create a new file in project called `.size_tracker` with files separated by new line
2. Run the script
3. Script will log size of the tracked files and create a report
